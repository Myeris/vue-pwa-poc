[Vue.js PWA POC](https://vue-pwa-poc.firebaseapp.com/home)

## Use in standalone

Android should prompt you to install the app on your homescreen.
On iOS, you will need to go in "Share" => "Add to homescreen".   

## Running the app locally

Run the following command

```
yarn install && yarn serve
```

## Build the app

```
yarn build
```

The app will be served on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
